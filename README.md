# `r4sl`

This text is currently written as a supplement to [ISL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) for use in [STAT 432, Basics of Statistical Learning](https://stat432.org/) at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Some additional details and additional topics are included, but the main focus in on providing more thorough `R` examples. Eventually the goal is to have a completely self-contained text. However, given its massively popularity in the field, we feel that it is still extremely useful to read ISL in its entirety. 

## Development Status

- **April 2020** - Significant updates are expected during the Summer of 2020. 
	- Re-unification of `r4sl` with `bsl`.
