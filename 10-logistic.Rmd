# Logistic Regression


In this chapter, we continue our discussion of classification. We introduce our first model for classification, logistic regression. To begin, we return to the `Default` dataset from the previous chapter. 

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(tibble)
as_tibble(Default)
```

We also repeat the test-train split from the previous chapter.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
default_idx = sample(nrow(Default), 5000)
default_trn = Default[default_idx, ]
default_tst = Default[-default_idx, ]
```


## Linear Regression

Before moving on to logistic regression, why not plain, old, linear regression?

```{r}
default_trn_lm = default_trn
default_tst_lm = default_tst
```

Since linear regression expects a numeric response variable, we coerce the response to be numeric. (Notice that we also shift the results, as we require `0` and `1`, not `1` and `2`.) Notice we have also copied the dataset so that we can return the original data with factors later.

```{r}
default_trn_lm$default = as.numeric(default_trn_lm$default) - 1
default_tst_lm$default = as.numeric(default_tst_lm$default) - 1
```

Why would we think this should work? Recall that,

$$
\hat{\mathbb{E}}[Y \mid X = x] = X\hat{\beta}.
$$

Since $Y$ is limited to values of $0$ and $1$, we have

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X = x] = P(Y = 1 \mid X = x).
$$

It would then seem reasonable that $\mathbf{X}\hat{\beta}$ is a reasonable estimate of $P(Y = 1 \mid X = x)$. We test this on the `Default` data.

```{r}
model_lm = lm(default ~ balance, data = default_trn_lm)
```

Everything seems to be working, until we plot the results.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
plot(default ~ balance, data = default_trn_lm, 
     col = "darkorange", pch = "|", ylim = c(-0.2, 1),
     main = "Using Linear Regression for Classification")
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)
abline(h = 1, lty = 3)
abline(h = 0.5, lty = 2)
abline(model_lm, lwd = 3, col = "dodgerblue")
```

Two issues arise. First, all of the predicted probabilities are below 0.5. That means, we would classify every observation as a `"No"`. This is certainly possible, but not what we would expect.

```{r}
all(predict(model_lm) < 0.5)
```

The next, and bigger issue, is predicted probabilities less than 0.

```{r}
any(predict(model_lm) < 0)
```


## Bayes Classifier

Why are we using a predicted probability of 0.5 as the cutoff for classification? Recall, the Bayes Classifier, which minimizes the classification error:

$$
C^B(x) = \underset{g}{\mathrm{argmax}} \ P(Y = g \mid  X = x)
$$

So, in the binary classification problem, we will use predicted probabilities

$$
\hat{p}(x) = \hat{P}(Y = 1 \mid { X = x})
$$

and 

$$
\hat{P}(Y = 0 \mid { X = x})
$$

and then classify to the larger of the two. We actually only need to consider a single probability, usually $\hat{P}(Y = 1 \mid { X = x})$. Since we use it so often, we give it the shorthand notation, $\hat{p}(x)$. Then the classifier is written,

$$
\hat{C}(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
      1 & \hat{p}(x) > 0.5 \\
      0 & \hat{p}(x) \leq 0.5 
\end{cases}
$$

This classifier is essentially estimating the Bayes Classifier, thus, is seeking to minimize classification errors.


## Logistic Regression with `glm()`

To better estimate the probability

$$
p(x) = P(Y = 1 \mid {X = x})
$$
we turn to logistic regression. The model is written

$$
\log\left(\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots  + \beta_p x_p.
$$

Rearranging, we see the probabilities can be written as

$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots  + \beta_p x_p)}} = \sigma(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots  + \beta_p x_p)
$$

Notice, we use the sigmoid function as shorthand notation, which appears often in deep learning literature. It takes any real input, and outputs a number between 0 and 1. How useful! (This is actually a particular sigmoid function called the logistic function, but since it is by far the most popular sigmoid function, often sigmoid function is used to refer to the logistic function)

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

The model is fit by numerically maximizing the likelihood, which we will let `R` take care of.

We start with a single predictor example, again using `balance` as our single predictor.

```{r}
model_glm = glm(default ~ balance, data = default_trn, family = "binomial")
```

Fitting this model looks very similar to fitting a simple linear regression. Instead of `lm()` we use `glm()`. The only other difference is the use of `family = "binomial"` which indicates that we have a two-class categorical response. Using `glm()` with `family = "gaussian"` would perform the usual linear regression.

First, we can obtain the fitted coefficients the same way we did with linear regression.

```{r}
coef(model_glm)
```

The next thing we should understand is how the `predict()` function works with `glm()`. So, let's look at some predictions.

```{r}
head(predict(model_glm))
```

By default, `predict.glm()` uses `type = "link"`.

```{r}
head(predict(model_glm, type = "link"))
```

That is, `R` is returning

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 x_2 + \cdots  + \hat{\beta}_p x_p
$$
for each observation.

Importantly, these are **not** predicted probabilities. To obtain the predicted probabilities

$$
\hat{p}(x) = \hat{P}(Y = 1 \mid X = x)
$$

we need to use `type = "response"`

```{r}
head(predict(model_glm, type = "response"))
```

Note that these are probabilities, **not** classifications. To obtain classifications, we will need to compare to the correct cutoff value with an `ifelse()` statement.

```{r}
model_glm_pred = ifelse(predict(model_glm, type = "link") > 0, "Yes", "No")
# model_glm_pred = ifelse(predict(model_glm, type = "response") > 0.5, "Yes", "No")
```

The line that is run is performing

$$
\hat{C}(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
      1 & \hat{f}(x) > 0 \\
      0 & \hat{f}(x) \leq 0 
\end{cases}
$$

where 

$$
\hat{f}(x) =\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 x_2 + \cdots  + \hat{\beta}_p x_p.
$$

The commented line, which would give the same results, is performing

$$
\hat{C}(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
      1 & \hat{p}(x) > 0.5 \\
      0 & \hat{p}(x) \leq 0.5 
\end{cases}
$$

where 

$$
\hat{p}(x) = \hat{P}(Y = 1 \mid X = x).
$$

Once we have classifications, we can calculate metrics such as the trainging classification error rate.

```{r}
calc_class_err = function(actual, predicted) {
  mean(actual != predicted)
}
```

```{r}
calc_class_err(actual = default_trn$default, predicted = model_glm_pred)
```

As we saw previously, the `table()` and `confusionMatrix()` functions can be used to quickly obtain many more metrics.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
train_tab = table(predicted = model_glm_pred, actual = default_trn$default)
library(caret)
train_con_mat = confusionMatrix(train_tab, positive = "Yes")
c(train_con_mat$overall["Accuracy"], 
  train_con_mat$byClass["Sensitivity"], 
  train_con_mat$byClass["Specificity"])
```

We could also write a custom function for the error for use with trained logist regression models.

```{r}
get_logistic_error = function(mod, data, res = "y", pos = 1, neg = 0, cut = 0.5) {
  probs = predict(mod, newdata = data, type = "response")
  preds = ifelse(probs > cut, pos, neg)
  calc_class_err(actual = data[, res], predicted = preds)
}
```

This function will be useful later when calculating train and test errors for several models at the same time.

```{r}
get_logistic_error(model_glm, data = default_trn, 
                   res = "default", pos = "Yes", neg = "No", cut = 0.5)
```

To see how much better logistic regression is for this task, we create the same plot we used for linear regression.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
plot(default ~ balance, data = default_trn_lm, 
     col = "darkorange", pch = "|", ylim = c(-0.2, 1),
     main = "Using Logistic Regression for Classification")
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)
abline(h = 1, lty = 3)
abline(h = 0.5, lty = 2)
curve(predict(model_glm, data.frame(balance = x), type = "response"), 
      add = TRUE, lwd = 3, col = "dodgerblue")
abline(v = -coef(model_glm)[1] / coef(model_glm)[2], lwd = 2)
```

This plot contains a wealth of information.

- The orange `|` characters are the data, $(x_i, y_i)$.
- The blue "curve" is the predicted probabilities given by the fitted logistic regression. That is,
$$
\hat{p}(x) = \hat{P}(Y = 1 \mid { X = x})
$$
- The solid vertical black line represents the **[decision boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary)**, the `balance` that obtains a predicted probability of 0.5. In this case `balance` = `r -coef(model_glm)[1] / coef(model_glm)[2]`.

The decision boundary is found by solving for points that satisfy

$$
\hat{p}(x) = \hat{P}(Y = 1 \mid { X = x}) = 0.5
$$

This is equivalent to point that satisfy

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 = 0.
$$
Thus, for logistic regression with a single predictor, the decision boundary is given by the *point*

$$
x_1 = \frac{-\hat{\beta}_0}{\hat{\beta}_1}.
$$

The following is not run, but an alternative way to add the logistic curve to the plot.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
grid = seq(0, max(default_trn$balance), by = 0.01)

sigmoid = function(x) {
  1 / (1 + exp(-x))
}

lines(grid, sigmoid(coef(model_glm)[1] + coef(model_glm)[2] * grid), lwd = 3)
```


Using the usual formula syntax, it is easy to add or remove complexity from logistic regressions.

```{r}
model_1 = glm(default ~ 1, data = default_trn, family = "binomial")
model_2 = glm(default ~ ., data = default_trn, family = "binomial")
model_3 = glm(default ~ . ^ 2 + I(balance ^ 2),
              data = default_trn, family = "binomial")
```

Note that, using polynomial transformations of predictors will allow a linear model to have non-linear decision boundaries.

```{r}
model_list = list(model_1, model_2, model_3)
train_errors = sapply(model_list, get_logistic_error, data = default_trn, 
                      res = "default", pos = "Yes", neg = "No", cut = 0.5)
test_errors  = sapply(model_list, get_logistic_error, data = default_tst, 
                      res = "default", pos = "Yes", neg = "No", cut = 0.5)
```

Here we see the misclassification error rates for each model. The train decreases, and the test decreases, until it starts to increases. Everything we learned about the bias-variance tradeoff for regression also applies here.

```{r}
diff(train_errors)
diff(test_errors)
```

We call `model_2` the **additive** logistic model, which we will use quite often.


## ROC Curves

Let's return to our simple model with only balance as a predictor.

```{r}
model_glm = glm(default ~ balance, data = default_trn, family = "binomial")
```

We write a function which allows use to make predictions based on different probability cutoffs.

```{r}
get_logistic_pred = function(mod, data, res = "y", pos = 1, neg = 0, cut = 0.5) {
  probs = predict(mod, newdata = data, type = "response")
  ifelse(probs > cut, pos, neg)
}
```

$$
\hat{C}(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
      1 & \hat{p}(x) > c \\
      0 & \hat{p}(x) \leq c 
\end{cases}
$$

Let's use this to obtain predictions using a low, medium, and high cutoff. (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9)

```{r}
test_pred_10 = get_logistic_pred(model_glm, data = default_tst, res = "default", 
                                 pos = "Yes", neg = "No", cut = 0.1)
test_pred_50 = get_logistic_pred(model_glm, data = default_tst, res = "default", 
                                 pos = "Yes", neg = "No", cut = 0.5)
test_pred_90 = get_logistic_pred(model_glm, data = default_tst, res = "default", 
                                 pos = "Yes", neg = "No", cut = 0.9)
```

Now we evaluate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for these classifiers.

```{r}
test_tab_10 = table(predicted = test_pred_10, actual = default_tst$default)
test_tab_50 = table(predicted = test_pred_50, actual = default_tst$default)
test_tab_90 = table(predicted = test_pred_90, actual = default_tst$default)

test_con_mat_10 = confusionMatrix(test_tab_10, positive = "Yes")
test_con_mat_50 = confusionMatrix(test_tab_50, positive = "Yes")
test_con_mat_90 = confusionMatrix(test_tab_90, positive = "Yes")
```

```{r}
metrics = rbind(
  
  c(test_con_mat_10$overall["Accuracy"], 
    test_con_mat_10$byClass["Sensitivity"], 
    test_con_mat_10$byClass["Specificity"]),
  
  c(test_con_mat_50$overall["Accuracy"], 
    test_con_mat_50$byClass["Sensitivity"], 
    test_con_mat_50$byClass["Specificity"]),
  
  c(test_con_mat_90$overall["Accuracy"], 
    test_con_mat_90$byClass["Sensitivity"], 
    test_con_mat_90$byClass["Specificity"])

)

rownames(metrics) = c("c = 0.10", "c = 0.50", "c = 0.90")
metrics
```

We see then sensitivity decreases as the cutoff is increased. Conversely, specificity increases as the cutoff increases. This is useful if we are more interested in a particular error, instead of giving them equal weight.

Note that usually the best accuracy will be seen near $c = 0.50$.

Instead of manually checking cutoffs, we can create an ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) which will sweep through all possible cutoffs, and plot the sensitivity and specificity.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(pROC)
test_prob = predict(model_glm, newdata = default_tst, type = "response")
test_roc = roc(default_tst$default ~ test_prob, plot = TRUE, print.auc = TRUE)
as.numeric(test_roc$auc)
```

A good model will have a high AUC, that is as often as possible a high sensitivity and specificity.


## Multinomial Logistic Regression

What if the response contains more than two categories? For that we need multinomial logistic regression. 

$$
P(Y = k \mid { X = x}) = \frac{e^{\beta_{0k} + \beta_{1k} x_1 + \cdots +  + \beta_{pk} x_p}}{\sum_{g = 1}^{G} e^{\beta_{0g} + \beta_{1g} x_1 + \cdots + \beta_{pg} x_p}}
$$

We will omit the details, as ISL has as well. If you are interested, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression) provides a rather thorough coverage. Also note that the above is an example of the [softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function).

As an example of a dataset with a three category response, we use the `iris` dataset, which is so famous, it has its own [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). It is also a default dataset in `R`, so no need to load it.

Before proceeding, we test-train split this data.

```{r}
set.seed(430)
iris_obs = nrow(iris)
iris_idx = sample(iris_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * iris_obs))
iris_trn = iris[iris_idx, ]
iris_test = iris[-iris_idx, ]
```

To perform multinomial logistic regression, we use the `multinom` function from the `nnet` package. Training using `multinom()` is done using similar syntax to `lm()` and `glm()`. We add the `trace = FALSE` argument to suppress information about updates to the optimization routine as the model is trained.

```{r}
library(nnet)
model_multi = multinom(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn, trace = FALSE)
summary(model_multi)$coefficients
```

Notice we are only given coefficients for two of the three class, much like only needing coefficients for one class in logistic regression.

A difference between `glm()` and `multinom()` is how the `predict()` function operates.

```{r}
head(predict(model_multi, newdata = iris_trn))
head(predict(model_multi, newdata = iris_trn, type = "prob"))
```

Notice that by default, classifications are returned. When obtaining probabilities, we are given the predicted probability for **each** class.

Interestingly, you've just fit a neural network, and you didn't even know it! (Hence the `nnet` package.) Later we will discuss the connections between logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and simple neural networks.


## `rmarkdown`

The `rmarkdown` file for this chapter can be found [**here**](10-logistic.Rmd). The file was created using `R` version `r paste0(version$major, "." ,version$minor)`. The following packages (and their dependencies) were loaded when knitting this file:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs)
```
